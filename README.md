# Coronal-dimmings-analysis--Functions
The analysis of coronal dimmings lifetime can provide information on Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).
In particular, the end-of-life of coronal dimmings may help in understanding how the magnetic connection between the CME expanding out into space and the solar corona is maintained. It is a relatively new field, but promising.

This repository shows the steps necessary steps for the analysis of coronal dimmings and includes two methods for the observation of the dimming recovery (return to, or exceeding of, the pre-dimming intensity).
